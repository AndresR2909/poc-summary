Faithfulness**\\n- The submission provides an introduction, analysis, recommendations, and conclusion, but there are several factual inaccuracies and hallucinations:\\n  - It mentions the S&P 500 with a level of \"3.444\", which is not present in the source text (the S&P 500 is only mentioned as \"plano\", and the number 3444 does not appear).\\n  - It refers to the \"Dow Jones Industrial Average (DAX)\", which is a conflation of two different indices (Dow Jones is US, DAX is German). The source only mentions DAX, not Dow Jones.\\n  - The DAX levels in the submission (\"10.900\" and \"11.100\") are not exactly as in the source, which gives levels like 11177, 11162, 11188, 11171.\\n  - The gold price is given as \"123,33 dólares por onza\", which is a misreading; the source says \"12333\" as the price of opening the week, but the actual gold price context is between 2333 and 2344.\\n  - The submission omits many of the specific technical levels and nuances present in the source, and invents some numbers.\\n  - The \"Recomendaciones\" section is generic and not present in the source.\\n  - The \"Activos recomendados\" section is missing entirely, despite being explicitly requested.\\n- Therefore, the submission is not fully faithful to the source.\\n\\n**2. Relevance**\\n- The submission does cover some main points (mentions of indices, gold, oil, dollar index), but omits many key details:\\n  - It does not mention any of the \"7 magníficas\" (Apple, Tesla, Nvidia, Amazon, Meta, Netflix) by name in the bullet points, which are central to the source.\\n  - It omits Bitcoin, which is discussed in the source.\\n  - It does not include the requested \"Activos recomendados\" section.\\n  - It includes generic recommendations not present in the source.\\n- Therefore, the submission does not include all the main information and omits significant details.\\n\\n**3. Conciseness**\\n- The submission is relatively concise and avoids unnecessary repetition.\\n- However, some sections (like the repeated \"Análisis de Niveles Intradiarios\" and \"Análisis de Posiciones Abiertas\") are redundant and could be merged.\\n- The inclusion of generic recommendations adds unnecessary content.\\n- Overall, it is not excessively verbose, but the redundancy and irrelevant recommendations detract from conciseness.\\n\\n**4. Coherence**\\n- The submission is structured with an introduction, analysis, recommendations, and conclusion.\\n- The structure is clear, but the confusion between indices (Dow Jones/DAX), incorrect numbers, and missing key sections (like \"Activos recomendados\") make it less clear and potentially confusing for the reader.\\n- The lack of specific asset names in the bullet points also reduces clarity.\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n- The submission fails on faithfulness, relevance, and to a lesser extent, conciseness and coherence.\\n\\nN', 'value': 'N', 'score': 0} | Embedding Score:0.24817448440301815 | StringScore:2\n",

Faithfulness:**  \\nThe submission claims it cannot provide financial advice or analysis, but offers to summarize the conversation.

However, the summary is extremely generic and does not accurately reflect the specific content, technical analysis, or detailed points discussed in the source text. For example, it omits the discussion of the EMA 200, the specific projections for Bitcoin, the analysis of the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, the mention of altcoins, and the tactical recommendations.

Instead, it simply states that it cannot fulfill the request and gives a vague description of the content, mentioning \"Jormo Bowler\" (which is a misreading of \"Jerome Powell\") and generally referencing the discussion about cryptocurrencies and financial events. It does not fabricate facts, but it also does not accurately summarize or reflect the main points of the source text. The mention of \"Jormo Bowler\" is a hallucination/misreading, which is a factual inaccuracy.\\n\\n**Relevance:**  \\nThe submission does not include the main information from the source text. It omits all significant details, such as the focus on Bitcoin, the RSI analysis, the trading strategy, the emphasis on stop loss, and the recommendation of Bitget. It does not provide any of the requested structured content (introduction, key points, conclusion, recommended assets). Therefore, it fails on relevance.\\n\\n**Conciseness:**  \\nWhile the submission is brief, it is not concise in the sense required by the task, because it does not summarize the main points at all. Conciseness is not just about brevity, but about efficiently conveying the essential information, which is missing here.\\n\\n**Coherence:**  \\nThe submission is coherent in the sense that it is readable and its sentences follow logically. However, it is not well-structured as per the requested format (introduction, key points, conclusion, recommended assets). It does not follow the structure required for the task.\\n\\n**Conclusion:**  \\nThe submission fails on faithfulness, relevance, and coherence (as per the task\\'s requirements), even though it is readable.

The use of \"ETF\\'s\" and \"CDs\" is not faithful to the original text.\\n- The submission also refers to \"marcos\" and \"bebés\" as actions, but \"marcos\" is likely a misreading of \"Grupo Argos\" or another company, and \"bebés\" is not a stock; the original text refers to \"BVC\" (Bolsa de Valores de Colombia) or \"BEBES\" as a typo for \"BVC\" or \"Bancolombia\".

This is a hallucination.\\n- The submission lists \"Tesla\" as a rebounding stock, but the source text only mentions Nvidia and Microsoft specifically, not Tesla.\\n- The submission refers to \"Big Tech (BIX)\", but the source text refers to \"el big se ha relajado\" and \"los futuros del bx\", which seems to refer to the VIX (volatility index), not a \"Big Tech\" index.\\n- The submission includes a \"Recomendaciones\" section, which is not part of the requested format and introduces advice not present in the source.\\n- The submission omits the \"Activos recomendados\" section as a separate, clearly labeled list, as required by the instructions.\\n- Therefore, the submission is not fully faithful.\\n\\n**2. Relevance**\\n- The submission covers the main points: Bitcoin\\'s technical situation, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, Oro, and mentions the context of macro events (Fed, volatilidad, etc.).\\n- It omits insignificant details and focuses on the main actionable information.\\n- However, it introduces assets not mentioned in the source (BTC-ABC, ETC, Tesla), which is not relevant.\\n- The submission also includes a \"Recomendaciones\" section, which is not in the source and not requested.\\n- Therefore, the submission is not fully relevant.\\n\\n**3. Conciseness**\\n- The submission is relatively concise and avoids excessive repetition.\\n- However, the inclusion of assets not mentioned in the source and the extra \"Recomendaciones\" section adds unnecessary content.\\n- Therefore, it is not fully concise.\\n\\n**4. Coherence**\\n- The submission is generally well-structured, with clear sections and logical flow.\\n- However, the inclusion of a \"Recomendaciones\" section not requested, and the mixing of assets not in the source, slightly detracts from coherence.\\n- The date mismatch also creates confusion.\\n- Therefore, it is not fully coherent.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** The submission fails on faithfulness, relevance, conciseness, and coherence due to factual inaccuracies, hallucinated content, and deviation from the requested format.\\n\\nN', 'value': 'N', 'score': 0} | Embedding Score:0.17757861974341893 | StringScore:2\n",

The reference answer includes this section, listing \"acciones\" and noting that \"criptomonedas\" are not recommended.\\n\\n**Conclusion:**  \\n- While the summary is accurate, relevant, concise, and coherent, the omission of the \"Activos recomendados\" section means it does not fully meet the task instructions. Therefore, it does not meet all criteria.\\n\\nN', 'value': 'N', 'score': 0} | Embedding Score:0.13309129306376455 | StringScore:5\n",

The source text discusses Bitcoin in the 90,000-100,000 range, not 18,000-19,000. The submission also mentions coins like Polkadot (PKT), Moonbeam (MOON), and Chia (XCH), which are not mentioned in the source. The summary is generic and does not reflect the specific tactical advice, the \"encerrona\" strategy, or the focus on RSI and risk management that are central to the source.\\n- Therefore, the submission is not faithful to the source.\\n\\n**2. Relevance**\\n- The submission omits the main tactical and strategic points from the source, such as the \"encerrona\" strategy, the emphasis on RSI, the warnings against over-leverage, and the specific approach to stop loss. Instead, it provides a generic technical analysis with invented price levels and a standard structure that does not reflect the unique content of the source.\\n- It also fails to include the extensive list of altcoins discussed in the source, and instead lists some that are not mentioned.\\n- Therefore, the submission is not relevant to the main information in the source.\\n\\n**3. Conciseness**\\n- The submission is relatively concise and avoids unnecessary repetition. However, since it includes fabricated and irrelevant information, the conciseness is not in service of accurately summarizing the source.\\n\\n**4. Coherence**\\n- The submission is well-structured and easy to follow, with clear sections and logical flow. However, the coherence is undermined by the lack of faithfulness and relevance to the source material.\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n- The submission fails on faithfulness and relevance, even though it is concise and coherent in structure.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer is:\\n\\nN', 'value': 'N', 'score': 0} | Embedding Score:0.19882294836503955 | StringScore:1\n",

      "# Guía para Invertir en Bolsa o Forex\n",
      "\n",
      "Invertir en bolsa o mercados de divisas (Forex) es un proceso complejo que exige una comprensión profunda del mercado, disciplina y paciencia. A continuación, se presentan los aspectos clave a considerar antes de comenzar:\n",
      "\n",
      "## Requisitos Previos\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Capital Inicial Sustancial**: \n",
      "   - Los grandes inversores como Warren Buffett o George Soros suelen empezar con cantidades significativas de capital. Para lograr rentabilidades sostenibles, se recomienda tener al menos entre 200 y 500 millones de pesos para considerar la posibilidad de vivir del trading.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Educación Financiera**:\n",
      "   - Dedica tiempo a aprender sobre finanzas, economía y análisis técnico y fundamental. Esto podría tomar varios años antes de estar preparado para operar con éxito en los mercados.\n",
      "   \n",
      "3. **Disciplina y Paciencia**: \n",
      "   - El mercado de valores es volátil. Es crucial mantener la calma durante las fluctuaciones y no hacer movimientos impulsivos.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Mitos Comunes\n",
      "\n",
      "- **No se Viven del Trading con Pocos Ingresos**: \n",
      "  - La idea de vivir solo con cinco o diez mil dólares en el trading es un mito. Los rendimientos mensuales promedio que logran los grandes gestores rondan entre el 1% y el 3%, no superiores al 10%.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Rentabilidades Fijas No Existen**:\n",
      "  - Ofrecer o aceptar rentabilidades fijas en Forex o acciones es un signo de estafa. Los rendimientos pueden ser negativos o positivos, sin garantías.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Estrategias de Inversión\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Diversificación del Portafolio**:\n",
      "   - No pongas todos tus recursos en una sola inversión. Distribuir el capital entre diferentes activos puede reducir riesgos.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Análisis Técnico y Fundamental**:\n",
      "   - Aprende a analizar gráficos de precios (análisis técnico) y las condiciones económicas generales (análisis fundamental).\n",
