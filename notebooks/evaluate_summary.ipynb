Thus, the submission does not include the main information and omits significant details.\\n\\n3. **Conciseness**: The submission is concise in its response, but it is concise to the point of being unhelpful. It does not provide any useful summary or analysis of the source text, which is the task at hand. While it avoids unnecessary repetition, it fails to deliver any relevant content.\\n\\n4. **Coherence**: The submission lacks coherence in the context of the task.

Faithfulness**\\n- The submission provides an introduction, analysis, recommendations, and conclusion, but there are several factual inaccuracies and hallucinations:\\n  - It mentions the S&P 500 with a level of \"3.444\", which is not present in the source text (the S&P 500 is only mentioned as \"plano\", and the number 3444 does not appear).\\n  - It refers to the \"Dow Jones Industrial Average (DAX)\", which is a conflation of two different indices (Dow Jones is US, DAX is German). The source only mentions DAX, not Dow Jones.\\n  - The DAX levels in the submission (\"10.900\" and \"11.100\") are not exactly as in the source, which gives levels like 11177, 11162, 11188, 11171.\\n  - The gold price is given as \"123,33 dólares por onza\", which is a misreading; the source says \"12333\" as the price of opening the week, but the actual gold price context is between 2333 and 2344.\\n  - The submission omits many of the specific technical levels and nuances present in the source, and invents some numbers.\\n  - The \"Recomendaciones\" section is generic and not present in the source.\\n  - The \"Activos recomendados\" section is missing entirely, despite being explicitly requested.\\n- Therefore, the submission is not fully faithful to the source.\\n\\n**2.

Conciseness**\\n- The submission is relatively concise and avoids unnecessary repetition.\\n- However, some sections (like the repeated \"Análisis de Niveles Intradiarios\" and \"Análisis de Posiciones Abiertas\") are redundant and could be merged.\\n- The inclusion of generic recommendations adds unnecessary content.\\n- Overall, it is not excessively verbose, but the redundancy and irrelevant recommendations detract from conciseness.\\n\\n**4. Coherence**\\n- The submission is structured with an introduction, analysis, recommendations, and conclusion.\\n- The structure is clear, but the confusion between indices (Dow Jones/DAX), incorrect numbers, and missing key sections (like \"Activos recomendados\") make it less clear and potentially confusing for the reader.\\n- The lack of specific asset names in the bullet points also reduces clarity.\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n- The submission fails on faithfulness, relevance, and to a lesser extent, conciseness and coherence.\\n\\nN', 'value': 'N', 'score': 0} | Embedding Score:0.24817448440301815 | StringScore:2\n",

Relevance**\\n- The submission does attempt to include some main points, such as the corrective bias, the importance of certain levels, and the lack of news.\\n- However, it omits several important details, such as the context of the Fed decision, the specific levels for both BTC and ETH, and the broader market context (indices, ETFs, etc.).\\n- It also introduces irrelevant or incorrect information (e.g., 15,000 for ETH, 65.98 for ETH CM).\\n- Therefore, it does not fully meet the relevance criterion.\\n\\n**3. Conciseness**\\n- The submission is relatively concise and avoids unnecessary repetition.\\n- However, the inclusion of incorrect or irrelevant information (e.g., fabricated levels) detracts from its conciseness, as it adds confusion and unnecessary content.\\n- Still, in terms of length and repetition, it is not verbose.\\n\\n**4. Coherence**\\n- The submission is somewhat structured, with sections and bullet points.\\n- However, the structure is not fully aligned with the requested format (missing clear introduction, conclusion, and a separate list of recommended assets).\\n- The section \"Producios de Ethereum (ETH)\" is incoherent and seems out of place.\\n- The summary is not as clear or easy to follow as the reference answer, and the misattribution of levels and products makes it confusing.\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n- The submission fails on faithfulness and relevance due to inaccuracies, hallucinations, and omission of key information.\\n- Conciseness is mostly met, but coherence is also lacking due to structure and clarity issues.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer is:\\n\\nN', 'value': 'N', 'score': 0} | Embedding Score:0.21825599490211978 | StringScore:3\n",

Faithfulness**\\n- The submission claims the text is not a summary or analysis but a transcript, and then provides a general analysis about strategies and indicators, focusing on the importance of not relying solely on indicators and having a strategy.\\n- However, the source text is a detailed, if rambling, market analysis with specific projections, price levels, trading strategies, and mentions of various assets. The submission omits all the specific content, such as the projection of Bitcoin to $24,700, the mention of a \"12 days of terror\" period, the use of stop loss, the discussion of specific assets (BTC, XRP, BNB, etc.), and the emotional/psychological aspects discussed.\\n- The submission fabricates a focus on \"the 4 v\" (velocidad, volatilidad, tendencia y volumen), which is not a central theme in the source text, and does not accurately reflect the main points or structure of the original.\\n- Therefore, the submission is not faithful to the source text.\\n\\n**2. Relevance**\\n- The submission omits the main information from the source text: the technical analysis, the specific price levels, the trading strategies, the emotional/psychological advice, and the list of assets discussed.\\n- Instead, it provides generic advice about not relying on indicators and having a strategy, which is not the main content of the source.\\n- It also fails to extract or list the assets mentioned as options of investment, which was a required section.\\n- Therefore, the submission is not relevant.\\n\\n**3. Conciseness**\\n- The submission is concise and not verbose. It does not repeat itself unnecessarily.\\n- However, conciseness alone is not enough if the content is not faithful or relevant.\\n\\n**4. Coherence**\\n- The submission is structured and easy to follow. It has clear sections and logical flow.\\n- However, the structure does not match the required format (introduction, key points in bullet form, conclusion, and a separate list of assets), and the content is not coherent with the source\\'s main points.\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n- The submission fails on faithfulness and relevance, even though it is concise and coherent in itself.
